# 嘉年华堆堆乐 (Gift Pile)

## How it runs

The physics is [Rapier](https://rapier.rs) (`@dimforge/rapier2d-compat`, WASM inlined) in a
module Web Worker, `pile-worker.ts`. The worker owns a `PileEngine` (`core/engine.ts`): the
floor and walls are fixed colliders, each falling icon a dynamic ball with no bounce and some
friction, so heaps form. Once a ball has been near enough to still for a while it is taken out
of the engine and a fixed ball is left in its place, so the engine only ever simulates what is
moving. The worker steps at `stepHz` and posts a `Frame` (`core/protocol.ts`) after each tick:
the moving icons' positions and the ones that just settled. On the page, `PileClient` takes the
frames in and `PileRenderer` draws at display rate, interpolating moving icons between the last
two frames and stamping settled ones onto a static layer once.

Two engine settings matter (`core/config.ts`): the world is handed to Rapier in metres with an
icon 1 m across (`pxPerMetre`), because Rapier's tolerances and speed cap are in metres and
pixel units made every fall crawl; and `contactHz` raises contact stiffness from Rapier's
default of 30 to 120, without which a fast stream sank icons into each other by most of a
radius.

## TODO

- Drag an icon into a rubbish bin to destroy it. Only what it was holding up needs to move again: wake the resting icons touching it from above, and let each one that starts moving wake the ones resting on it in turn. Repaint only that part of the resting layer.
- A vacuum at the mouse for about a second, pulling nearby icons in. Icons need a velocity in any direction for this, not just a speed along their way down.
- A blast that destroys every icon in range: the same as the rubbish bin for many icons at once, found through the grid, with the icons around the hole woken.
